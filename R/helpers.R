#' Find path for files in `/inst/extdata/`
#' 
#' Looks for `inst/` in the working directory, otherwise wraps [fs::path_package()] with appropriate defaults for this package.
#' 
#' @details 
#' This function **will be deprecated** when all data files are retrieved via APIs.
#' 
#' As a [stop-gap measure](), data files are stored in `inst/extdata/` and compiled into the package.
#' Depending on the context in which you want to use these files, their paths will differ.
#' When running from the source root, they can be found at `inst/extdata/`.
#' When the package is compiled (as in vignette use), they can be found at `extadata/`.
#' 
#' This function automatically picks the correct path or throws an error if the file cannot be found.
#'
#' @param x `[character(1)]` giving the filename or path to the file from `inst/extdata/`
#' 
#' @return `[character(1)]` giving the absolute path to `x`, as returned by [fs::path_abs()].
